Bug - no score as we generate the grid, have to move one thing
Big Bug - "subwords" count to score... hmmmmm

Show which tiles are part of words - borders on the tiles?
Remove Calc Score - make it "list words" - put all words/scores under board
Border on the tiles!
Does it work on mobile/other browsers?


Check the date and have a "date->puzzle" word/seed generation
Seed -- print it and a way to set/enter it?
Leaderboard -- pointsx10-turns? something? and backend
Publish -- how do you say "this is my score" or do we track best or...?
Dailies -- a way to set a word+seed for a day? or we make one up each day? 
"Main word" - a <width> letter word that uses the tricky letter?

    git checkout main
    git merge cleanup
  Maybe also push the merged branch back up
    git push origin main


Git Stuff:
  git push -u origin cleanup
    pushes the cleanup branch, also -u makes cleanup the default branch for now
  git checkout main
  git merge cleanup
    to merge into main - checkout the main branch, then merge into it
  git branch -d cleanup
  git push origin --delete cleanup
    remove the dead branch
