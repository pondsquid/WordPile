Use the Cleanup Branch
  Optional: Use Branches for Cleanup and Features
  To keep your main branch clean:
    Create a branch for cleanup:
    git checkout -b cleanup
  Commit all your cleanup fixes there.
  Merge back into main once stable:
    git checkout main
    git merge cleanup

Git Stuff:
  git push -u origin cleanup
    pushes the cleanup branch, also -u makes cleanup the default branch for now
  git checkout main
  git merge cleanup
    to merge into main - checkout the main branch, then merge into it
  git branch -d cleanup
  git push origin --delete cleanup
    remove the dead branch
